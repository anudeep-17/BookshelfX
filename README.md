# BookshelfX: Library Management System -- Technical Assesment

BookshelfX is a full-stack web application designed to replicate the functionality of a local library. It enables users to manage and browse a collection of books. The application supports two roles: **librarian** and **customer**. Below, I've outlined the project milestones, along with a project management perspective for each phase.

## Project Milestones

### 1. Project Setup and Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set up the development environment with necessary tools and frameworks.
- [ ] Choose and configure the front-end and back-end frameworks.
- [ ] Establish the database connection and initialize the project structure.

### 2. Front-End Development
- [ ] Implement user interfaces for librarian and customer functionalities.
- [ ] Integrate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- [ ] Develop features for browsing, searching, filtering, and sorting books.
- [ ] Implement book review functionality with a star rating system.
- [ ] Design and style the web application for optimal user experience.

### 3. Back-End Development
- [ ] Design and implement RESTful API endpoints to support librarian and customer actions.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization logic.
- [ ] Develop controllers and services for CRUD operations on books.
- [ ] Set up database migrations and seed the database with test data.

### 4. Database Implementation
- [ ] Define the database schema (tables for books, users, reviews, etc.).
- [ ] Implement code-first migrations to create the database structure.
- [ ] Seed the database with test data (librarians, customers, books).

### 5. Testing and Quality Assurance
- [ ] Write unit tests for front-end and back-end components.
- [ ] Conduct integration tests to ensure seamless communication.
- [ ] Perform user acceptance testing to validate functionality and user experience.

### 6. Deployment and Release
- [ ] Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing.
- [ ] Address any issues or bugs identified during the testing phase.
- [ ] Prepare the application for production deployment.
- [ ] Deploy the application to a production environment for public access.

### 7. Documentation and Maintenance
- [ ] Document installation instructions, usage guidelines, API endpoints, and database schema.
- [ ] Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the application.
- [ ] Incorporate user feedback and feature requests for future iterations.

## Conclusion
By following these milestones and project management practices, we aim to deliver a high-quality library management system that meets the needs of both librarians and customers.ðŸ“šðŸŒŸ
